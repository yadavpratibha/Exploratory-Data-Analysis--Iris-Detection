# Exploratory Data Analysis – Iris Detection 🌸

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the popular Iris flower dataset. It focuses on visualizing, summarizing, and understanding the structure and relationships of features within the dataset to assist in detecting different Iris species.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `iris.csv` – The dataset file containing Iris flower measurements.
- `EDA_Iris.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with all EDA steps and visualizations.
- `README.md` – Project documentation.

## 📊 Dataset Information

The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

Each sample has the following features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

## 🧠 Objectives

- Load and understand the structure of the dataset
- Handle missing or inconsistent data (if any)
- Generate summary statistics and feature distributions
- Visualize data using plots (histograms, scatter plots, box plots, pair plots, etc.)
- Analyze relationships between features and Iris species

## 📈 Libraries Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📌 Key Insights

- Visual differences between species based on petal and sepal dimensions
- Strong separability of Iris-setosa in visual plots
- Petal measurements are more indicative of species classification than sepal measurements

## ✅ How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
